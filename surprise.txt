When you said no surprises, but they surprise you anyway
When someone posts a meme, using the old meme format
Winning while playing, rock paper scissors in the mirror
When your mom calls, you by your full name
When changing random code, fixes the problem
Caesar when Brutus, stabs him
The first person, to get Rickrolled
Winning a prize at a hackathon, with a mediocre project
Using the wrong formula, to get the right answer
